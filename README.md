This application enables a PDS node to register all its data products for long term preservation and sharing with the rest of the PDS system.

It is composed of 2 services:
 - registry manager (the database manager) : for details see https://github.com/NASA-PDS/pds-registry-mgr-elastic
 - harvest (tools to get/prepare metadata for the registry) : for details see https://github.com/NASA-PDS/harvest
 
The purpose of this repository is to integrate together these services and package them conveniently for the users.

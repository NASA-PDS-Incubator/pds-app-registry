Main components of multi-node cluster:
<ul>
  <li><b>Elasticsearch</b> nodes - store PDS data and provide low level search API. </li>
  <li><b>API</b> nodes - provide PDS registry API. Only API nodes are exposed to public network.</li>
  <li><b>Load balancer / proxy server</b> - forwards user requests to API servers. Provides public HTTPS access point.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Nodes can be deployed in containers (Kubernetes) or VMs. 
</p>

<!-- ===================================== -->

<h4>VMs</h4>
<p>
To reduce VM overhead you can deploy multiple nodes of different type (Elasticsearch, API) in the same VM.  
It is recommended to have 3 VMs for HA setup.

<p>
Minimal non-HA configuration can be deployed in a single VM.

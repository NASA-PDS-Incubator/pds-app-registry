<p>
To view the Solr Admin UI on a remote server, you will need to have your System Administrator setup a proxy similar to the following:
</p>
<source>
ProxyPass /solr http://localhost:8983/solr
ProxyPassReverse /solr http://localhost:8983/solr
&lt;Location /solr&gt;
  &lt;Limit PUT POST DELETE&gt;
    Order Deny,Allow
    Deny from All
    Allow from 127.0.0.1
  &lt;/Limit&gt;
&lt;/Location&gt;

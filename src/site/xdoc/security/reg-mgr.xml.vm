<section name="Registry Manager Security">

<p>
Registry manager supports HTTPS connections to Elasticsearch and Basic Authentication.
We may add more authentication schemes in future releases.
</p>

<subsection name="Basic Authentication">

<p>
To enable Basic Authentication, create a configuration file in your home directory or another secure location. 
In this example we called the file <i>es-auth.cfg</i>, but you can use another name.
</p>

<p>
Provide user name, password, and optionally "trust.self-signed" flag, if your Elasticsearch server is using 
self-signed certificate for HTTPS connections.
</p>

<source>
trust.self-signed = true
user = elastic
password = mypassword
</source>

<p>
Pass security configuration file to a Registry Manager command in "-auth" command-line parameter.
For example,
</p>

<source>
registry-manager create-registry -es https://myserver.com:9200 -index test1 -auth /home/user1/es-auth.cfg
</source>

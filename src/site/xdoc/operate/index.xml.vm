    <p>
    To test your deployment we will ingest a few datasets in your new registry.
    </p>
    
    <p> This operation is done in 2 steps:
	    <ul>
	    	<li>convert pds records into registry records, with command <i>harvest</i></li>
	    	<li>push the registry record to the server, with command <i>registry-mgr</i></li>
	    </ul>
	    
	    
    </p>
    <subsection name="harvest">
	    <p>To run this command we need a <b>configuration</b> file to reference the data source. </p>
	    <p>Edit the example file provided in <i>harvest-$context.get("harvest.version")/conf/harvest/examples/harvest-policy-master.xml</i></p>
	    <p>Update the following section with the path of the test dataset in the package, you may use your own dataset, that is even better:</p>
	    
	    <source>

	    <p>We now need an <b>output directory</b> where the registry records will be created, for example, on unix, <i>~/tmp</i></p>
	    
	    
	    <p>At last, <b>run</b> the harvest command</p>
	    <source>
harvest -c &lt;path to the package&gt;/harvest-$context.get("harvest.version")/conf/harvest/examples/harvest-policy-master.xml -o ~/tmp

	<subsection name="registry-mgr">
		<p>To push the newly created registry record to the server, simply run (~/tmp is the path where the input records created in the previous step are):</p>

registry-mgr ~/tmp

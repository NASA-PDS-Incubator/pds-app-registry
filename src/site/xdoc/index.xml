<section name="About PDS Registry">
<p>
PDS Registry provides functionality for tracking, searching, auditing, locating, and maintaining artifacts within the system. 
These artifacts can range from data files and label files, schemas, dictionary definitions for objects and elements, services, etc. 
The core functionality for this component is satisfied by <a href="https://www.elastic.co/" target="_blank">Elasticsearch</a>.
</p>

<p>
For Build 9b (June 2019), the Registry and Search components of the PDS4 system received a major upgrade 
and significant re-design to greater leverage the power of Elasticsearch. 
We are continuing to improve our documentation, but please do not hesitate to send questions, comments, 
change requests and bug reports to the <a href="mailto:pds_operator@jpl.nasa.gov">PDS Operator</a> 
at pds_operator@jpl.nasa.gov and we would be happy to help work through any issues you are having.

  <li><b>Java</b> is required to run Elasticsearch, Harvest, Registry Manager and other tools.</li>
  <li>Registry data is stored in <b>Elasticsearch</b>.</li>
  <li><b>Registry Manager</b> command-line tool is designed to load, delete and export registry data. 
It can also create and delete registry index in Elasticsearch.</li>
  <li><b>Harvest</b> is a tool to crawl and extract metadata from PDS4 files.
Extracted metadata is stored in an "intermediate" JSON or XML file which can be loaded into Elasticsearch 
or Solr by Registry Manager or other tools.</li>

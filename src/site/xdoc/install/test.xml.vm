    <p>
    To test your deployment we will ingest a few datasets in your new registry.
    </p>
    
    <p> This operation is done in 2 steps:
	    <ul>
	    	<li>convert pds records into registry records, with command <i>harvest</i></li>
	    	<li>push the registry record to the server, with command <i>registry-manager</i></li>
	    </ul>
	    
	    
    </p>
    <subsection name="harvest">
	    <p>To run this command we need a <b>configuration</b> file to reference the data source. </p>
	    <p>Edit the example file provided in <i>harvest-$context.get("harvest.version")/conf/examples/minimal.xml</i></p>
	    <p>Update the following section with the path of the test dataset in the package, you may use your own dataset, that is even better:</p>
	    

<source><![CDATA[
<!-- 
Specify the top level directory / bundle for Harvest to crawl for products to register 
-->
<directories>
  <path>{absolute path to the package}/test/dph_example_archive/</path>
  <fileFilter>
    <include>*.xml</include>
  </fileFilter>
</directories>
]]></source>

<p>See details on the harvest configuration on <a href="../operate/harvest.html">operate harvest</a></p>
	    
	    <p>We now need an <b>output directory</b> where the registry records will be created, for example, on unix, <i>~/tmp</i></p>
	    
	    
	    <p>At last, <b>run</b> the harvest command</p>
<source>
harvest -c &lt;path to the package&gt;/harvest-$context.get("harvest.version")/conf/examples/minimal.xml -o ~/tmp
</source>
    
	</subsection>
	
	<subsection name="registry-manager">
		<p>To push the newly created registry record to the server, simply run (~/tmp is the path where the input records created in the previous step are):</p>
<source>
registry-manager load-data -file ~/tmp
</source>
	</subsection>
	
	<subsection name="query the registry">
		<p>Open in your browser: <a href="http://localhost:9200/registry/_search?q=*">http://localhost:9200/registry/_search?q=*</a></p>
	</subsection>
	
	
	<subsection name="reset your registry">
		<p>To reset your registry and other common operations, see documentation on <a href="..//operate/reg-manager.html">registry manager</a></p>

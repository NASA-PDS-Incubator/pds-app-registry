<p>
SolrCloud is a cluster of Solr servers that provides fault tolerance and high availability.
It uses Apache ZooKeeper for cluster configuration and coordination.
Number of nodes you need, usually depends on amount of data, number of queries, fault tolerance and high availability requirements.
</p>
<p>
There are two main SolrCloud deployment types: single Solr server with embedded ZooKeeper and
multinode deployment with separate Solr and ZooKeeper clusters.
</p>

<!-- ============================== -->

<h4>Single Solr Server with Embedded ZooKeeper</h4>
<p>
This is the simplest configuration of SolrCloud. A single instance of ZooKeeper and Solr server are running in the same JVM.
This setup does not provide any fault tolerance or high availability, and could not be expanded.
This configuration is recommended for development or testing and can be easily installed on a laptop or desktop.

<!-- ============================== -->

<h4>Multinode Cluster</h4>
<p>
This configuration is recommended for production. It provides fault tolerance and high availability.
Both ZooKeeper and Solr clusters can be expanded by adding more nodes.
